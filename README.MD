This is a rudimentary fork of the [stock hid app](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/tree/8c2223df5dfc9c5b1119adee634e53610ca504d1/applications/system/hid_app) that only includes the vertical keynote.

It replaces the back button with support for a laser (see [flipper-laserpointer](https://github.com/Badbird5907/flipper-laserpointer/)).


**Note:** This app is in development, and not completed.
>[!TIP]
> You can use the laser pointer by holding the back button down, or pressing it once to toggle the laser on and off.
> To exit the keynote, rapidly press the back button 3 times.
